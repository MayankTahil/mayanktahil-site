# Work Experience @ Bellamkonda Labs

### Lab Affliate / Researcher @ Georgia Institute of Technology [Bellamkonda Labs](http://www.bellamkondalab.net/)
August 2012 - October 2014

Helped engineer a novel micro neural implant for bi-directonal neural interfacing with the Peripheral Nervous System for robotic limb control. This DARPA sponsored research directly addresses current amputeesâ€™ lack of ability to consciously control mobility and receive sensation from smart prosthetic limbs.

* Performed surgeries, histological and electrophysiology studies on murine models for chronic in vivo trials to investigate host acceptance post implantation of medical device. Published a manuscript as second author on resulting nerve and biological response.

* Performed and developed protocols to assemble the micro medical device post clean room fabrication. Optimized bench top workflow (hours to minutes) by utilizing Arduino (C/C++) to identify micro wires and associated PCB micro bonding pads during device fabrication. Furthermore, optimized data analysis through coding in Python.

### [A regenerative microchannel device for recording multiple single-unit action potentials in awake, ambulatory animals](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.13080/full?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3By7JCjXuTSzKf%2BgVf3NAjKg%3D%3D)
**European Journal of Neuroscience**
**Published on**: Oct 28, 2015

This study reports on the development of a fully integrated, regenerative microchannel interface with microelectrodes for nerve signal extraction and capabilities to enabling evaluation in an awake and ambulatory rat animal model. This study marks a significant advance in neural interfacing, demonstrating the capability of microchannels to be used for communicating with peripheral nerves.

### [Microchannels as a Regenerative Construct for Peripheral Nerve Interfacing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25522974?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B86eGMF1VRHmFBu%2BFCUvwXA%3D%3D)
**Biomaterials**
**Published on:** Feb 01, 2015

These studies showed that precisely fabricated microchannels support and direct the regeneration/migration of axons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts through the microchannels during nerve regeneration and recovery. Results provided evidence that the construct is biologically compatible for in vivo peripheral neural interfacing.
