*Mayank has been a great teammate and brought many process improvements and innovations to light, while working as a Technology Specialist covering the NetScaler products with focus on DevOps integration, Cloud (AWS Lead, Azure, Google, SoftLayer/IBM, Oracle, as well as Microservices and integration with Mesos/Marathon/similar....), ADC and SD-WAN in general, and focusing also on Management and Analytics. Mayank wrote labs, built demo environments, scored the highest feedback at a recent conference for his Speaking Engagement on CICD, build a Docker Repository and Git library, and generally covered his role fully. He can be found online with many presentations and recordings available, and I find his ability to communicate and present complex technology and relate to business value to be a key value. I recommend Mayank and hope to work with him again soon. Very mature, self starter, and accountable.*
