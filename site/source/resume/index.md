This study reports on the development of a fully integrated, regenerative microchannel interface with microelectrodes for nerve signal extraction and capabilities to enabling evaluation in an awake and ambulatory rat animal model. This study marks a significant advance in neural interfacing, demonstrating the capability of microchannels to be used for communicating with peripheral nerves.

### [Microchannels as a Regenerative Construct for Peripheral Nerve Interfacing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25522974?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B86eGMF1VRHmFBu%2BFCUvwXA%3D%3D)

**Published on:** Feb 01, 2015

These studies showed that precisely fabricated microchannels support and direct the regeneration/migration of axons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts through the microchannels during nerve regeneration and recovery. Results provided evidence that the construct is biologically compatible for in vivo peripheral neural interfacing.

*Mayank has been a great teammate and brought many process improvements and innovations to light, while working as a Technology Specialist covering the NetScaler products with focus on DevOps integration, Cloud (AWS Lead, Azure, Google, SoftLayer/IBM, Oracle, as well as Microservices and integration with Mesos/Marathon/similar....), ADC and SD-WAN in general, and focusing also on Management and Analytics. Mayank wrote labs, built demo environments, scored the highest feedback at a recent conference for his Speaking Engagement on CICD, build a Docker Repository and Git library, and generally covered his role fully. He can be found online with many presentations and recordings available, and I find his ability to communicate and present complex technology and relate to business value to be a key value. I recommend Mayank and hope to work with him again soon. Very mature, self starter, and accountable.*
